Strategy (2026)
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 10:10 PM
Twins

Boss 1:
General instructions:
Everyone hold ult until slayer callout
All range DD's beam weapons as soon as it spawns
Dome holder will move dome out of boss at 80% and then come back in if (1) boss channels or (2) 2nd same-colour atro comes in
When boss is about to start teleport phase, all DD's: Tab target boss and take mental note of where your orb is
Slayer at 2nd atro
Ult-order: All DD's -> H1 Naz -> H2 PP. Tanks ult at their discretion
OT: Start with boss and MT will take later. When wrong-colour atros and stack out of group (~ 1-2 o'clock position just outside dome)
MT: Coordinate boss swaps. Stack same-colour atros on boss and keep them at center during teleport

Teleport Phase 1:
DD's go to assigned domes. If freed up, drop DoT's in middle
Last DD with dome. If there were leftover right-colour atros, MT takes them there, that DD will hold dome until atros they are dead
Dome holder: Wait for old dome to drop
MT help interrupt with crushing shock
Tip on not getting the wrong dome: Look at the orb beside you and take the dome of opposite colour

Boss 2:
Same as Boss 1

Teleport phase 2:
Same as Teleport Phase 1

End of Teleport Phase 2:
If there are left over right-colour atros, MT stack them on last teleport dome, DD's will go kill them ASAP.
H2 takes dome when atros on MT (if any) are dead and slow walk boss back to their side with the MT (watch weapons)
OT will be left with 2 atros and a boss for some time 20-30 seconds. Use magma shell to survive as needed
H1 will take dome and pocket heal OT on large side
Execute will start with
Large side: OT, H1 [SPC], all DD but DD8
Small side: MT, H2 [PP], DD8
 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 10:38 PM
Execute Phase 1: This is when all DDs are in large side and before swap at 15%
Large side:
Start with a slayer:
Ult-order: All DDs -> H1 [SPC] Naz extend -> Tanks ult whenever they like. DD's ult on cooldown afterwards
Ult on CD thereeafter
H1 stays out of dome for jump rescue
DPS6 and DPS7 swap domes on jump/brands. DPS6 grabs first
Small side:
DPS8 kills weapons right after a mech finishes and calls out
H2 [PP] holds dome initially. If someone else has dome and PP off-cooldown, then go over to large side to pop a PP
If OT is on small side and nobody is grabbing dome (e.g. dead or cooldown), take dome and Magma
Tanks:
Stack puddles along sides and not on the other players. L-shape pattern along the corner is ideal
If boss swapping during brands, don't run into DD's doing brands.

Swap sides: When large side boss is at 15% and no active mech is happening, side swaps would be called
All DDs and healers will swap. Dome holders will stay until someone takes dome off of them. Tanks will always stay
Both healers drop HoT's in their old dome before leaving

Execute Phase 2:
Everyone just burn
Can largely ignore weapons

Final execute: large-side boss is dead
DD's check if they got dome. If they do, drop it
Once DD's are sure they dont have dome, then run over to finish

General reminders:
Block weapon waves if:
Before execute
You are not tank
Roll-dodge weapon weaves if:
At execute, especially same colour wave
You are tank
Dome holders during execute: 
Move vertically when possible (along entrance <-> exit)
The only time you move horizontally, it is if boss is channeling at the middle outside of dome. Even then, be very careful
Remember that you have dome and watch for where the boss you are supposed to cover is standing
 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 10:56 PM
Reef Guardians

Prelude: Before fight starts
All DD's but Reef Group 1 and DPS8 go downstairs to Chalice

Tip to tanks: Reef Guardians never loose taunt and will always follow the last person who taunted them

Chalice (Start):
Everyone hold ult
MT: Taunts Large Guardian
OT: Taunts Medium #1 when Large splits at 99%. OT ults whenever he wants
Downstairs DDs: Kill heart at Chalice and come up
Upstairs DDs: Burn Medium #1 and any Smalls that get spawned
Slayer ult: DDs + MT -> H1 Naz's -> H2 PP's

Crossbones: 
When Crossbones is being activated:
MT grabs Large Guardian and put him on the left side of the reef
OT can grab all the small and medium and stack on right side
Upstairs DD parse the Large Guardian on left side only. Right side atros do not get burn for now so that we don't push them to spawn reefs. No ults
When Crossbones heart is at 40%:
Reef Group 1 will inform group
OT takes the large reef guardian into right stack
Upstairs DD lay DoT's on right side
When Crossbone heart clears:
DPS8 comes up while Reef Group 1 proceeds to Skull as normal
Ult dump: DD's and MT ult -> H1 Naz  ->  H2 PP
Follow standard pattern ever after
 
General pattern (after Crossbones)
The upstairs DD stays at a reef until its mage spawns and is killed (this removes the need for an OOT). Then it will go clockwise to the next reef and repeat
OT will stack reef guardians on the right side of a reef. He ults whenever he likes
MT will keep an eye out for adds spawned from new reef channels. He also grabs mages and rubberbands them into group
H1 focuses group and MT and H2 pocket heals OT
Slayer and PP will be called by MT and H2. Timing should be when enemies are stacked and not while running
Criteria to move to next reef (one of):
There are 2 active channels in the reefs after the current one (e.g. Skull and Anchor channelling while at Crossbones)
The mage of the current reef is dead
OT and RL will decide when to move
The whole idea is to ensure each Reef Group does 2 hearts in sequence instead of 1.
Backward reefs: 
If a boss goes counter-clockwise to channel (e.g. going from Crossbones to Crown), it's a "backwards" reef and reef backup DDs need to go down immediately to kill it
MT needs to be mindful that once a backwards reef clears, the mage and animals are spawned very far away and he needs to watch for them before they come in to kill the group

Note: 
DPS8 helps clear first Crossbones to speed up the mage spawn + death for Crossbones so that group can move to Skull faster
If bosses run backwards, 2 reef backup DD's go down immediately to kill that heart
Both Mediums + Small #1 should be out by end of Chalice
Small #2 should spawn near transition between Crossbones and Skull

Reef Number Table
Group 1: 2,3 (Crossbones/Skull)
Group 1: 6,7 (Crown/Chalice) - Fight should end by the time we get here ***
Group 1: 10,11 (Anchor/Wheel)

Group 2: 4,5 (Anchor/Wheel)
Group 2: 8,9 (Crossbones/Skull)
Group 2: 12,13 (Crown/Chalice) 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 11:09 PM
Taleria

Start:
Drop DoT's on Taleria as she spawns
Ult dump: DDs -> OT (front) and H2 (back) proc slayer + PP
H1 wait for Naz extend at Maelstrom when first barrier runs out

While not in Winter Storm:
OT will kite slam slightly out of stack (everyone make sure to get out of slam)
Waves: If absolutely certain that OT's wave is not on you, keep parsing. Otherwise, roll dodge
Maelstrom: Keep parsing until add-on tell you to roll-dodge, then always do the roll-dodge
Matrons: If there are matrons in range, DoT or beam matrons. Do not go after matrons that are too far

Winter Storm:
Group leads MT before Maelstrom (so that doesnt need to move during Maelstrom), MT leads MT after Maelstrom (so that he get space)
If Winterstorm spawns at MT's side, MT and group roll through each other so that group leads
Maelstrom: Usually happens one time at 4-5 clock units from the origin. BSack tight for Maelstrom while it happens. Ult-dump sequence will usually happen at this Maelstrom
While running: Always try to stay well ahead while parsing Taleria. H2 will provide Major and Minor Expedition.
Matrons: When Matrons spawn, OT ele sus and DDs put DoT's (if any) and beam backwards from Taleria to kill Matrons

First Bridge Spawns:
Watch Maelstrom timer
If it is within 10 seconds: Group stay for Maelstrom first before doing anything
Bridge DD's will go to their bridge (roll dodge through MT if needed, so to avoid cleave damage)
Group would want to move to the dome next to the bridge (there is a coloured icon on map)
Unless dome is very close, MT will always lead the group to the dome will go run to the destination (MT make sure the group is in dome). This is to ensure everyone goes the same direction and MT gets heals
Everyone but MT hold ults
 
If Green Dome:
This dome drains resources and ult. Drop any ult you have ASAP
Watch resources (especially stam). HA/potion/siphoning attacks as needed so that there is enough stam for RD/break free
Healers can forget about PoE uptimes if they want to play it safe
Healers running out of mag and people dying to siren lures here are a risk

If Purple Dome:
This dome has heal debuff. Healers and MT need to be extra careful with health
Maelstrom and purple mage can be quite deadly. Healers may want to alternate barriers on Maelstrom for safety
Don't be near the purple mage

If Yellow Dome:
This dome applies a speed debuff. If Deluge happens, go to the edge a few seconds early
First Bridge Clears:
OT gets mage and stacks her on Taleria
After mage is dead group, should get out of dome to clear the debuff
If second bridge already spawned, use the movement heuristic above (e.g. Maelstrom timer, where the next destination is etc)
If second bridge has not yet spawned, MT move over a bit and let the group get out of dome
 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 11:19 PM
Second Bridge Spawns:
Same as first bridge if we are not skipping 2 bridges
Otherwise, same as Execute

Execute:
Group should always be skipping last bridge unless they are doing the Full Tour Achievement
All skipped bridges will have their debuff applied to group until Taleria dies, so pay attention to what dome is up and be mindful of the debuffs from it

Skipping 2 bridges (unlikely):
If the group has enough damage (1.06M group DPS, or average DPS of 132.5K)  and the first bridge is not green, then the group hold ult.
The group stops FOO and DoT's at 41% and stop damage at 38%
OT takes mage out of group until group burns Taleria
Burn on Taleria will happen when: 
Bridge clear
Either Winterstorm or Maelstrom happens. If Winterstorm, move along the winds as the group pushes
Ideal scenario: Bridge clears and Maelstrom happens, this gives extra time for burn before Bridge 2 spawns
One trick that can be attempted: Wait for Winterstorm before pushing Bridge 1. This extends the time for the net Winterstorm to spawn when Bridge 1 clears and the group can more easily wait for the Maelstrom to happen without a risking Winterstorm
 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 11:36 PM
Trash pulls
Supports never ult
DDs can ult until last or 2nd last pull (use your best judgement, as Standards are expensive)

Sail Ripper/Bowbreaker marathon
People not responsible for levers will wait at exit as soon as trash are dead
People responsible for levers will either run straight to their levers or after trash are dead (at their discretion). For the last lever set before boss, use hot-key to change sets on Wizards' Wardrobe, and be prepared to be pulled in
Don't ult on Bowbreaker as you'd want to save it for Reef Guardians immediately after

Frost Cloak timings (reminders to you if you keep forgetting)
Maelstrom
End of Bridge when mage spawns
OT [Reef]
Twins:
There is no guard in this fight. Be tanky
Center phase: Take wrong-colour atros and hold them slightly out of dome and to the right of MT. Try to keep movement within a general area so that healers do not need to re-adjust their angles too much
Teleport phase 2: Survive
Start execute at large side. Expect ~ 20 seconds of abuse from boss + 2 atros since DD's will be on small side first to burn the last right-colour atros. Use Magma Shell as needed
If on small side and healer is on dome cooldown, be prepared to grab dome and use Magma Shell to survive

Sail Ripper/Bow Breaker Trash:
Be prepared to solo-tank fights since MT may be late from levers

Sail Ripper/Bow Breaker:
Take the boss and first adds since the other tank will be pulled in

Reef Guardian:
General:
You dictate where the group stacks.
Generally, if mage dies, go to next Reef and stack on the right side of that Reef
Don't be too greedy and overstay or you can have Medium's and Small's running backwards and that's bad
Start: Take Medium #1 when it spawns and stacks at Chalice
Chalice:
Take Medium #2 and all the Small's as they spawn
When mage is dead, call move and stack all the Medium's and Small's on right side of the next reef (clockwise)
Crossbones:
Magma shell or arcanist shield as needed. Tell group you are ulting so that H2 will PP for you
When MT takes Large over to your side, taunt the large
Medium #1 should go back to you when reef clears as taunt never clears
Grab cats if you want. Let MT take bears
Again, don't be too greedy
 
CommunistBanker721 — 2026-02-18 10:06 PM
Taleria:
Behemoth is always first priority to grab and tank. While Behemoth is alive, perma-block. No stagger when Behemoth is alive
Stack mage close to Taleria
Ele sus and taunt in-range matrons if possible
"Lure of the Sea" from Sirens while Behemoth's alive. 
Get out of melee range of behemoth until you break free. They make you drop block and get killed by Behemoth's LAs
Take waves out of group if possible (otherwise, tell the group to roll dodge)
Proc slayer (front) and ultigen whenever possible
Stagger only if no mages and behemoths
During winter storm: Stay with group if possible, keep Behemoth taunted. Don't get too close to MT or you'll die to cleave
